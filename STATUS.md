## 🏗️ TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### Current Stack

- **Language**: Go 1.21+
- **Database**: SQLite with JSON fields for flexibility
- **CLI**: Cobra for command structure
- **Testing**: Standard Go testing with testify assertions
- **Linting**: golangci-lint with comprehensive rules

### Package Structure

```terminal

└── maps/          # Google Maps API integration (TODO)
```

### Database Schema

- `places` table with core place data and flexible JSON storage
- `user_data` table for user-added notes, tags, and custom fields
- Proper indexing for search performance
- Migration support for schema evolution

## 📊 CURRENT STATE SUMMARY

**Lines of Code**: ~2,200+ (excluding tests)
**Test Coverage**: >90% for implemented packages
**Commands Working**: `import`, `list`, `browse`, `review`, `export`, `version`
**Key Missing**: Web interface, data enrichment via APIs

The project has a solid foundation with full import to SQLite,
comprehensive testing, a working CLI, a fully functional interactive TUI,
and complete export functionality. The TUI provides rich browsing, searching,
and editing capabilities. Export supports CSV, GeoJSON, JSON, and Markdown formats.
The next major milestone is implementing data enrichment from Google Maps API.
